# Binary-Search

Python based example of using the binary search algorithm

In computer science, binary search, also known as half-interval search, logarithmic search, or binary chop, is a search algorithm that finds the position of a target value within a sorted array. Binary search compares the target value to the middle element of the array. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_algorithm

The goal of this example is to demonstrate that binary search is faster than naive search. You will see when testing with a list length of 50,000 it will take approx a minute (or longer) for naive search to complete where binary search takes a fraction of a second. Try adjusting the length value and running the tests again and again to compare the results.

## Running the test

`python3 binary_search.py`
